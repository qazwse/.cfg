* .cfg Readme
A repository for storing my Linux configurations, based on the work found [[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles][here.]] Allows one to use a git repository set to work in $HOME, makes it easy to play around and distrohop.

I have two branches set up, one for Windows (WSL, technically) and one for more generic Linux distros. I could probably have them be the same, but they'll probably need a few subtle tweaks, so it's easier to have them seperate.

Currently, they're mostly being used for Emacs configurations. We'll see what the future holds.

TODO: Think about how this works with magit - probably more of a hassle than anything.

* Instructions
Because referring to the original website is kind of a hassle. I'll eventually move this into it's own fish script, but for now and org doc will do.

We need an alias to work with our config. Well, we don't need an alias, but it will save a lot of keystrokes.

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
alias -s config "/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME"
#+END_SRC

Clone my configuration, and checkout

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
git clone --bare https://github.com/qazwse/.cfg $HOME/.cfg
config checkout
#+END_SRC

Avoid weird recursion problems with this one simple trick, and ignore the files we don't track (don't want whole home directory appearing when we check status)

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
echo ".cfg" >> $HOME/.gitignore
config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
#+END_SRC

Clone the initial Doom Emacs repo, since Doom is fantastic~ Also install its requirements.
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
dnf install ripgrep fd-find
./$HOME/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
#+END_SRC fish
